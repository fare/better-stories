Better Stories, Better Languages (What Would Alyssa P. Hacker Do?)
==================================================================

This article, is based on my presentation of the same name,
initially a lightning talk at ILC'2009,
then grown into a presentation at Bay Area Lispers 2009,
< http://fare.tunes.org/computing/bal2009.pdf >
then made part of a presentation at LispNYC in October 2014:
< https://vimeo.com/152109286 >

It was submitted to SNAPL 2015, and rejected, having offended a reviewer
by presenting free software as an improvement over proprietary software:
