Better Stories, Better Languages (What Would Alyssa P. Hacker Do?)
==================================================================

This talk will be presented at LambdaConf 2017.
It is based on my presentation of the same name,
initially a lightning talk at ILC'2009,
then grown into a presentation at Bay Area Lispers 2009,
< http://fare.tunes.org/computing/bal2009.pdf >
then made part of a presentation at LispNYC in October 2014:

I also wrote an article that I submitted to SNAPL 2015, but it was rejected,
having offended a reviewer by presenting free software as
an improvement over proprietary software without qualification:
